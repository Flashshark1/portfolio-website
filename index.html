        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>
          The first meeting with our advisor and all members of the IETP Group
          16 was conducted. The primary objectives of the IETP project were
          discussed, including the development of practical thinking and
          laboratory skills, the cultivation of critical thinking and
          problem-solving abilities, the implementation of idea generation
          techniques, and the enhancement of collaboration and cooperative
          working skills. Furthermore, it was emphasized that the project aims
          to reflect the combined abilities of students from diverse academic
          backgroun. Additionally, the importance of effective time management
          was emphasized to ensure the timely completion of the project and to
          allow for recovery time in the event of any adverse circumstances.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>
          During the meeting, each team member presented their proposed ideas
          orally to the advisor, attempting to convince the advisor to select
          their respective ideas. After a collaborative discussion with the
          advisor, the <span> Project traffic control system </span> the idea i
          proposed, road breaking or car speed control system, farm monutering
          system and hydroponic was seen mainly. and we decided on combining
          farm monutering and hydroponic.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>
          The team members convened and completed Form-B, which contained the
          selected project title. Subsequently, the group engaged in a
          discussion regarding the preparation of the project proposal,
          including the sharing and allocation of tasks among the team members.
          The content and structure of the project proposal were thoroughly
          deliberated, with the team members clearly defining the expected
          content for each section. Finally, the team established a timeline for
          commencing the project and assigned specific responsibilities for
          drafting the project proposal.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>
          During the discussion, we focused on integrating the farm monitoring
          system with the hydroponic setup. We sketched out the structure and
          explored various design ideas, each presenting unique advantages and
          challenges. Key considerations such as feasibility, scalability, and
          affordability were thoroughly analyzed. These discussions allowed us
          to evaluate the practicality of combining the two systems while
          ensuring the solution would be effective and cost-efficient.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <p>
          We discussed methodologies and preparations, focusing on equipment,
          techniques, and challenges. We planned to use IoT-enabled sensors for
          real-time monitoring of soil and hydroponic conditions, incorporating
          microcontrollers and communication modules. Preparations included
          prototyping, sensor calibration, and developing user-friendly
          applications. Challenges included potential sensor malfunctions,
          connectivity issues, and ensuring affordability for smallholder
          farmers. <span>As a Civil engineer, My role</span> involved designing
          and analyzing structural frameworks for sensor installations, ensuring
          durability in diverse environments, and optimizing layouts for
          efficient resource use in both soil-based and hydroponic systems. We
          also reviewed the Bill of Materials (BOM) to ensure cost efficiency
          and scalability and outlined procurement processes for sourcing
          reliable components. Additionally, we addressed user adoption hurdles
          and environmental factors, emphasizing modularity and sustainability
          to overcome these concerns.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 6</h2>
        <p>
          we focused on sourcing electronics by comparing prices against the BOM
          to ensure cost-effectiveness.
          <span>As a civil engineer, my role</span> was to research options for
          3/16 hoses and alternative choices, contributing to the planning
          process. To address challenges like price variations and component
          availability, we prioritized flexible options and prepared contingency
          plans.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p>
          my role was to oversee the procurement of electronic components,
          ensuring they met the specifications outlined in the BOM. We
          successfully purchased the required components and conducted tests to
          confirm their functionality. This involved verifying that the
          components matched the expected quality and performance, ensuring
          alignment with the projectâ€™s goals. Key actions included sourcing the
          components, negotiating for the best prices, and testing them to
          ensure compatibility with the system design.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 8</h2>
